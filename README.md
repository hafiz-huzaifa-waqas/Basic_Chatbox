# **Basic Python Chatbot – ELIZA Inspired**

Hello! I am Huzaifa Siddiqui, and this is my Python mini-project:
"Basic Python Chatbot"

This is a simple Python-based conversational chatbot inspired by the classic ELIZA system.
It does not use any external AI or machine learning model — it relies purely on Python logic and conditional statements with a touch of sentiment analysis via TextBlob.

ELIZA, developed in the 1960s, was one of the first rule-based chatbots. This project is a small attempt to recreate that rule-based, modular, interactive conversation experience using Python.

## Features:
***Mood Detection:*** Detects user’s mood using TextBlob sentiment analysis and suggests a suitable activity based on the mood. 
--> Tells a joke
--> Tells a fact
--> Asks a riddle
--> Offers small games(guess number, Rock-Paper-scissor)
--> Polite Responses (Handles greetings, farewells, and small talk to make the conversation feel more interactive.)

## Note:
> This chatbot does not use AI or machine learning models — it's based entirely on conditional logic and sentiment polarity via TextBlob.
